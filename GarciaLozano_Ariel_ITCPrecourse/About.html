            <p class="interest-in-coding">Why am I interested in coding?</p>
            <p>One of the reasons is to be able to create, to bring ideas to life. I am a very creative person but it comes to coding, I have always depended on others to materialize my ideas. <br>Coding would allow me to do things by myself and get a better understanding of what happens behind the scenes. <br>Other reason is that I feel learning how to code as a big challenge, and I love challenging myself.</p>

            <p class="experiences">Educational and carrer experiences:</p>
            <p>I have been fortunate enough to expose myself to a wide variety of professions. From examining diamonds to clean houses, worked in a scientific health research, construction and in telecommunications. My studies haven't been safe from my search of meaning, but that has never stopped me from aiming high and hitting the target. Since I love technology my aim is now coding :).</p>

            <p class="interests">My personal interests:</p>
            <p>I love music, especially progresive metal. I love the complexity of the songs and how they are structured. I am a passionate of technology and anything related with space exploration and the Universe. I love animals but I don't have any, I am also interested in human behaviour, especially in extreme circumstances. I guess you never know yourself until you are brought to your very limits. And the same goes for other individuals. </p>
